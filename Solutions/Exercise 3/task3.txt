Task 3. Comprehension questions (2 points)
a) Are there conditions under which the results of a PCA and a PCoA are equivalent? If so, what are they? (1 P.)
b) What options exist to determine a meaningful number of dimensions for a PCoA? (1 P.)

Answers:

a) Yes, when we use the euclidian distance.
Minimizing linear distances is the same as maximizing linear correlations.

b) Look at the eigenvalues.
Similar to PCA the eigenvalues give us the ratios of explained variance in the distance matrix.

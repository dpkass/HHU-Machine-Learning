# Dereplication
derep:
        clustering : 1 # Percent identity for cdhit (dereplication) (1 = 100%), if cdhit is solely to be used for dereplication (recommended), keep the default value.
        length_overlap : 0.0 # Length difference cutoff, default 0.0 if set to 0.9, the shorter sequences need to be at least 90% length of the representative of the cluster.
        representative: most_common # Which sequence to use as a representative sequence per CDHIT cluster. longest = the longest sequence of the corresponding cluster, most_common = the most common sequence of the corresponding cluster.
